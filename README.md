# Club Membership Application
This application was created as part of the Advanced C# Tutorial Series created by Gavin Lon on youtube as means to learn about delegates in C#. 

# About Delegates
Delegates are typesafe function pointers in C#. They allow devs to create functions and call them in different ways by assigning them to delegates that have the same parameter list and return type. In this project I used delegates for validating a user's input 
when they provide details to register for a club. Although this project could have been easily made using regular static class functions it was a nice way to see how delegates are created and used. 

# Other Features
One cool part about this application is that the main program is created through interfaces instead of classes. Which makes this program very extensible.
